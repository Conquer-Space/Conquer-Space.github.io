# Contributing to Conquer Space

We welcome developers of any skill level to contribute to Conquer Space.

You can clone the repo [here](https://github.com/Conquer-Space/Conquer-Space), and follow the instructions to start contributing to the code base.


The doxygen documentation can be found [here](/docs/).


We are especially looking for Mac developers to get our Mac Build to work. We do not have any developers on Mac, and there are a few compilation issues to iron out when compiling for Mac. We also need to ensure that the OpenGL engine works, because Mac no longer supports the newer versions of OpenGL.

If you have any questions, we hang out on [Discord](https://discord.gg/h5r77Sa), we will be extremely happy to help you with any code questions
