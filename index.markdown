# Conquer Space

Conquer Space is a space themed grand strategy game with emphasis on economy, society, and politics.

It is set in the near future, where the barriers to space are greatly reduced, and gathering the resources and expanding to space becomes economically viable.

We use realistic orbital mechanics to model the logistical challenges societies of the future will have when transporting goods and resources between planets.
