# Conquer Space

Conquer Space is a space themed grand strategy game with emphasis on economy, society, and politics.

It is set in the near future, where the barriers to space are greatly reduced, and gathering the resources and expanding to space becomes economically viable.

Bring a nation from its budding space program, to launching its first satellites to space, to landing on the moon, to creating a self sustaining colony on other planets.

We use realistic orbital mechanics to model the logistical challenges societies of the future will have when transporting goods and resources between planets.
