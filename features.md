# Features
A complete list of proposed and completed features can be found here: <https://github.com/EhWhoAmI/cqsp/projects/2>

Conquer Space is built on 3 core pillars, economic, social, and political.

### Economic
 - Trade
    - International and interplanetary trade will play a large role in political and social relations
 - Logistics
    - There will have dozens of types of goods
    - Every different place and planet will have a different comparative advantage in producing a certain type of good.
 - Finance
    - Finance plays a huge role in the growth and contraction of the economy
  - Loans and investment will play a role in incentivizing the growth of the economy
     - The expansion of cheap space travel will unlock economic growth with no precedence
     - However, this needs massive investment

### Orbital Mechanics
 - Realistic orbital mechanics will play a large role in determining interplanetary logistics
 - We will have full pathfinding between planets so that interplanetary logistics can be automatically handled.

### Social
 - Culture
    - Becoming an interplanetary civilization will have huge impacts as to how we think about society
 - Media
    - Media will play a massive role in societies in the futures, and Conquer Space will have game mechanics to reflect that
 - Social conflict
   - Transitioning to an interplanetary will give social pre


### Political
 - Geopolitics
 - Internal politics
    - Colonizing a planet is not gonna be easy
    - Waiting for the launch window going to a planet will hinder sending resources, and asserting control over a colony

### General features
 - All three of these factors will influence each other
